# Mapping_Earthquakes
An interactive map of earthquakes


## The purpose of the repository



The purpose of this repository is to view the differences Between maps and to change the color based on the magnitude, The magnitude is expressed in whole numbers and decimal fractions.

1.  The first to detect tectonic plates location, 



2.  The Second one  major Earthquakes is specified with a green circle with a magnitude greater than 4.5 and   a select-option to display or no-display, 



3.  The third one for displaying Earthquakes

I have created 4 layers that will be the background of our map  which are  Streets, Satellite, Dark and  light
I did use D3.json  Retrieve the earthquake GeoJSON data and function to determine the color of the marker based on the magnitude of the earthquake 




__This analysis helps to display the cities most likely to be struck by an earthquake to take precautions in such as (Infrastructure) Implement new technologies for reinforcing new construction. -Build roads, bridges, and buildings near hills and fault lines Erect buildings close together using minimal construction materials to reduce the damage and Kepp people Safe __ .
